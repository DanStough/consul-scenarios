# Namespaced Services

This is meant to demonstrate creating and deleting namespaced services. 
It also provides a scenario for observing the deferred deletion of resources under a namespace.

## Prerequisites

Because this scenario uses namespaces, Consul Enterprise must be installed.
A path to a license file should be added to `CONSUL_LICENSE_PATH`.


## Running

```
./run.sh
```
